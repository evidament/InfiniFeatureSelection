# InfiniFeatureSelection
Feature selector inspired by "Generalized Distributed Monte Carlo Feature Selection  for high dimensional problems." by Łukasz Król

It can be used for extremaly high-dimensional datasets (the project is tested on 3mln features). Still work in progress, but it should be pretty much usable-ish.
